# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area? I think I am pretty good at time management when it comes to actually sitting down and doing my work. But me getting to the work is where I really struggle I need to follow my calender. 
- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is? A function is like a volume knob, when you turn this knob or (call the function) you will expect the same result everytime. You can use a different amount of inpup to change how the function acts when you interact with it but it will always be doing the same task on the inside even if there is a different outcome.  
- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group? I am pretty well off on this and I understand what it going on!
